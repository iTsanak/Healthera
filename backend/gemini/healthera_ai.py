If the product contains ingredients commonly used in processed, fried, or sugary foods (e.g., canola oil, palm oil, high fructose corn syrup), adjust the overall health score accordingly."
                "Bias Against Unhealthy Ingredients: Ingredients like canola oil, palm oil, vegetable oil, and high-fructose corn syrup and anything unhealthy or of similar type should always have lower scores due to their associations with processed or unhealthy products, regardless of other ingredients."
                "Health Score Assignment:Assign a health score between 0 and 100 for each ingredient based on its healthiness, with 0 being the least healthy and 100 being the healthiest."
                "**Overall Health Score Calculation**: Adjust the overall health score based on how the ingredients function together. For example, if the product contains a mix of highly processed ingredients, lower the score significantly, even if individual ingredients may score higher. Ensure the overall score is also between 0 and 100."
